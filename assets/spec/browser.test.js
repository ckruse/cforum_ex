 *  Tests for the functions provided by the browser module.
 *
 *
 *  @description
 *
 *  The functions exported from the browser module perform feature
 *  checks, some of whom are qualified to produce exceptions in case
 *  they are not implemented properly. This module is about testing
 *  these functions to reduce the possibility of a fatal error.
 *
 *
 *  The tests are implemented using the jasmine test framework,
 *  which is expected to be available and executed at the time this
 *  module is processed. The documentation of interfaces provided
 *  by the jasemine framework is outside the scope of this file
 *  and must be obtained from other sources, preferably the
 *  offical website of the project.

 *
 *  @description
 *
 *  There is no technical need to outsource the test functions
 *  for the module, but it improves readability and makes it easier
 *  to attach comments. Every member of the tests namespace object
 *  must have the same name as the function it is about to test.
 *  Thatâ€™s because the keys of tests are used as arguments to the
 *  describe function that is provided by the jasmine library.
 *
 *
 *  Anyway, please keep in mind, that the tests should be self
 *  explanatory, so comments should only be included to provide
 *  contextual information, for example about the purpose of the
 *  tested function or about properties that are not important
 *  enough to be included into the test suite.
